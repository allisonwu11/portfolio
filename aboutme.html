				<p> 	Hi! My name is Allison Wu and I am eleven years old. I am in sixth grade and I attend Miller Middle School. In my family, I live with my mom and dad. My sister, Lillian is currently at the University of Berkeley. Everyday after school, I go swimming and dancing. In my free time, I like to draw cartoon animals and read. I swim at the swim team Peak Swimming and I dance at Dance Academy USA in Production Company. My main friends are Alice, Alannah, Dara, Ava T., Ava R., Alison, Cara and Josephine. Follow me on instagram using the link above! I love watching anime. I suggest Naruto and Fairy Tail.

				<p> Every Saturday, I take a class for painting. To be specific, chinese painting. It is two hours long. Every class, I learn new ways of painting. Chinese painting is an old art, pretty hard to master. Down below, you will see an example of a famous chinese painting. </p>
