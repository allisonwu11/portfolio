				<p> 	Hi! My name is Allison Wu and I am eleven years old. I am in sixth grade and I attend Miller Middle School. In my family, I live with my mom and dad. My sister, Lillian is currently at the University of Berkeley. Everyday after school, I go swimming and dancing. In my free time, I like to draw cartoon animals and read. I swim at the swim team Peak Swimming and I dance at Dance Academy USA in the Production Company. My main friends are Alice, Alannah, Dara, Ava T., Ava R., Alison, Cara and Josephine. Follow me on instagram using the link above! I love watching anime. I suggest Naruto and Fairy Tail.

				<p> Every Saturday, I take a class for painting. To be specific, chinese painting. It is two hours long. Every class, I learn new ways of painting. Chinese painting is an old art, pretty hard to master. Down below, you will see an example of a chinese painting. </p>

				<p> Every week I go to Lynbrook for swim practice. At Peak Swimming, there are six groups, Elite, Jr. Elite, Gold, Platinem, Silver, and Bronze. I practice with Gold. Every day, we practice every stroke. Breastroke, Backstroke, Freestyle, and Butterfly. When you swim at Peak, there are a lot of fun activities. We have fundraisers and marathons, Over the years, I have made so many friends. If you want to join in on the fun, join Peak. Everyone is eligible if you know how to swim.

				<p> Another one of my activities is dancing. I have been dancing since I can remember. I am part of the team Dance Academy USA Production Academy and it's like being in a second family. I learn a lot from the classes they teach every week. We go to fun conventions and competitions and I always have fun.
